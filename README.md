Tools for crafting the web that are Probably Enough.

---

*Many projects do not need 80% of what we pretend they need.*

Probably Enough is a practical set of tools for people who love writing the web, but who don't want 400MB of node_modules to publish `index.html`.

## Probably Enough Tools:

- **[huebris.js](https://huebris.probablyenough.dev/)** A script for automating generation of hue-based CSS color palettes.
- **[nomustache](https://nomustache.probablyenough.dev/)** A simple and brutalist take on static site generation with Mustache templating and Markdown support.
