Tools for crafting the web that are Probably Enough.

---

*Most projects do not need 80% of what we pretend they need.*

Probably Enough is a practical set of tools for people who love writing the web, but who don't want 400MB of node_modules to say hello world.

## Probably Enough Tools:

- **[nomustache](https://nomustache.probablyenough.dev/)** A simple and brutalist take on static site generation with Mustache templating and Markdown support.
- **[huebris.js](https://huebris.probablyenough.dev/)** A script for automating generation of hue-based CSS color palettes.
<!-- - **[Probability Box](https://pbox.probablyenough.dev/)** A bash tool for simplifying management of self-contained dev environments with Docker.
    - generate and update custom docker configs via CLI UI
        - configs saved in git
        - common base tools included in question flow, ie. npm, nginx, php, composer, python, yarn, vue, laravel, redis, mariadb, postgres, nosql etc.
            - need to determine where to start - maybe npm, nginx, php, composer, nosql
    - shortcuts for creating, starting, stopping, destroying, and interacting with your environment(s)
- **[Probably Enough Cheatsheets](https://probablyenough.dev/cheatsheets/)** To-the-point cheatsheets for Probably Enough tools, vanilla web technologies, and even some (gasp!) frameworks and libraries I use. -->
