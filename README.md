Tools for crafting the web that are Probably Enough.

---

*Many projects do not need 80% of what we pretend they need.*

Probably Enough is a set of tools for people who love writing the modern web, but who don't want routing, bundling and dozens of dependencies just to publish `index.html`.

---

## Probably Enough Tools:

- **[huebris.js](https://github.com/ianleckie/huebris.js)** A script for automating generation of hue-based CSS color palettes.
- **nomustache** A simple and brutalist take on static site generation with Mustache templating and Markdown support. (coming soon)
